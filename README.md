</div>


I am currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at Grand Valley State University, MI. I work as a Graduate Research Assistant under the supervision of Dr. Rahat Ibn Rafiq, Assistant Professor in the College of Computing. Our project focuses on developing a system that makes plant disease detection more efficient and accessible.


I worked as a Software Engineer at bKash before starting my graduate studies. As part of the payment gateway team, I developed systems using reactive programming and AWS cloud components that serve 30 million regular users. My earlier experience was at REVE Systems, where I contributed to enterprise software solutions for the telecom sector.


I earned my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). My four-plus years in the fintech and telecommunications industries have allowed me to significantly build upon and apply the technical foundations established during my undergraduate.
